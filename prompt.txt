Act as a Senior Python Developer.

**Objective:**
Clean up the source code in the current directory (and all sub-directories) by removing all **Docstrings** and **Comments** from Python files (`.py`), making the code strictly functional and lightweight.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Scope:** Recursively scan all folders for `.py` files.
2.  **Removal Logic:**
    * **Docstrings:** Remove all module-level, class-level, and function-level docstrings (triple-quoted strings `"""..."""` or `'''...'''` that are not assigned to variables).
    * **Comments:** Remove all lines starting with `#` and inline comments (content after `#` on a code line).
    * **Empty Lines:** Clean up any excessive empty lines left behind after removal (e.g., ensure no more than 1 blank line between functions).
3.  **Safety Constraint (Crucial):**
    * You must differentiate between a **Docstring** and a **String Variable**. Do NOT remove triple-quoted strings that are assigned to a variable (e.g., `sql_query = """SELECT * FROM..."""` must remain).
    * Do NOT break indentation.

**Action:**
Write a Python script named `clean_code.py` using the `tokenize` or `ast` library to safely perform this task. Then, execute the script to clean all files in the current session.
