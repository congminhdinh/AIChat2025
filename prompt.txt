Task: Refactor the UI of Admin CMS and WebApp to use Tabler.io (Bootstrap 5) with a unified Blue & White theme.

1. Layout & Style:

Global Theme: Unified Blue/White aesthetic. Consolidate all common CSS into _Layout.cshtml.

Viewport: Remove Footer. Set layout to 100vh with a scrollable main content area (overflow-y: auto). Ensure no content is hidden or overlapped.

Icons & Buttons: Replace all text buttons with SVG Tabler Icons.

Claude must infer appropriate icons based on button text (e.g., Edit -> icon-edit, Delete -> icon-trash, Vectorize -> icon-bolt).

All icon buttons must have Bootstrap Tooltips (data-bs-toggle="tooltip") showing the original action text on hover.

2. Script & Path Logic (Crucial):

UrlRoot Integration: Stop using ~/ for internal assets.

Utils.js: Create/Update utils.js to define a global JavaScript variable UrlRoot. This UrlRoot should be populated from the WebAppUrl setting in appsettings.json (via Razor in _Layout.cshtml).

Path Refactor: Update all <script src="..."> and <link href="..."> tags to use the UrlRoot variable instead of the tilde ~/ prefix.

3. Functional Components:

Tables: Implement sticky headers, hover effects, and ensure "Bot Response" columns wrap text to fill available space.

Feedback Stats: Refactor as a 2-column Tabler Dashboard (Stats Cards on the left, Data Table on the right).
