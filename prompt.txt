Role: Senior .NET Fullstack Developer Context: AIChat2025 - Multi-tenant AI Chatbot System (Vietnamese Legal Documents) Task: Refactor the Document Management Module to support AJAX-based interactions, Partial View rendering, and a dedicated Document Viewer, while maintaining existing multi-tenant upload logic.

1. Technical Abstract
This update focuses on transitioning the Document Management module from static page reloads to a dynamic AJAX-driven architecture. The goal is to implement a seamless CRUD and Visualization experience using ASP.NET Core Partial Views. Key features include asynchronous list filtering, modal-based editing with hardcoded business logic (DocType = Initial, FatherDocumentId = -1), and a dedicated Document Viewer. A strict constraint is to preserve the existing multi-tenant upload pipeline, enhancing it only with success/error notifications (SweetAlert2/Toastr) to ensure a smooth user experience via the Index view.

2. Implementation Requirements
Please refactor my code according to these technical specifications:

A. Controller Structure (DocumentController.cs)
Index(): Return only the main layout shell.

GetDocuments(string keyword, int page): Return PartialView("GetListDocumentPartial") with filtered and paginated data.

GetById(int id): Return PartialView("GetDocumentDetail") for the edit modal.

Update(int id, string name): Update the document name, but strictly set DocType = "Initial" and FatherDocumentId = -1.

Delete(int id): Implement logic to remove the record and trigger the Vector DB (Qdrant) cleanup.

Vectorize(int id): Trigger the AI processing pipeline.

Upload Logic: DO NOT modify the internal storage/tenant logic. Only ensure it returns a JSON result or TempData that can be intercepted for notifications.

B. Frontend & AJAX Logic (document.js)
Implement a loadList(keyword, page) function to fetch the partial view into the main container.

Search: Trigger loadList on search input.

Vectorize/Delete: Use AJAX POST/DELETE with SweetAlert2 confirmation dialogs and success/error toasts.

Edit Modal: Fetch HTML from GetById, inject into a modal, and handle the Update submission via AJAX.

Upload Integration: After a successful file upload, trigger a success notification and refresh the list using loadList.

C. View Refactoring
Index.cshtml: Clean up to act as a container with placeholders for the list and modals.

GetListDocumentPartial.cshtml: Implement the table with Bootstrap pagination. Map status Enums to Vietnamese labels. Add action icons (CPU for Vectorize, Pencil for Edit, Trash for Delete).
