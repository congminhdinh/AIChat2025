Role: Expert .NET Fullstack DeveloperTask: Implementation of the Tenant Management Module in AdminCMS. Context & ReferenceCore Structure: You now understand the AdminCMS structure. We are implementing the Tenant module.Primary Logic: Strictly follow the architectural patterns and AJAX workflows defined in the attached UIShareLogic.txt1111.Service Integration: First, read the TenantEndpoint class within the TenantService to identify the correct API paths. Analyze the input/output models from TenantService and clone them into the AdminCMS project.2. Implementation StepsProject Components: Create TenantBusiness.cs, TenantController.cs, tenant.js scripts, and the necessary Razor views (Index, List Partial, Detail Partial) following the exact patterns in UIShareLogic.txt2222.CRUD Logic: For Tenant Management, implement CRU (Create, Read, Update) logic only. Do not implement a delete function3.3. Specific Functional RequirementsCreate Tenant Form: The partial view for creating a tenant should use an input model with the following properties:public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;public string? Description { get; set; }public string? Email { get; set; }public string? Password { get; set; }public string? AccountName { get; set; } = string.Empty;(Note: Omit IsActive and PermissionsList from the UI input fields).Disable Tenancy: Implement a DisableTenancy function to lock a tenant. This action requires a rigorous confirmation dialog (using the standard confirmation logic in the JS framework) before execution4.4. UI & Technical RulesAJAX Workflow: Use the defined AJAX Loop (Trigger → Request → Controller Processing → HTML/JSON Delivery → Injection) for all data operations5555.Pagination: Apply the Generic Table Rules, including backend pagination and the row index calculation: $STT = (CurrentPage - 1) * PageSize + CurrentRowIndex + 1$6666.Feedback: Ensure Loading States and JSON-based Action Feedback (Toastr/SweetAlert2) are implemented for all operations7.
