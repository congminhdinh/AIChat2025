Act as a Senior Software Architect and Technical Writer. Your task is to refine Section 2.3 (Functional Specification) of the file "chapter_2_revised_outline.md" based on the actual logic implemented in this repository.

### MANDATORY STEPS:
1. SCANNING: Thoroughly scan the C# (.NET 9) and Python (FastAPI) code to identify:
   - The exact metadata schema used in the RAG pipeline (e.g., hierarchy, tenant_id, source mapping).
   - The actual processing flow: How RabbitMQ events, Hangfire jobs, and SignalR streams interact.
   - The specific class names and service responsibilities.

2. UPDATING USE CASES: Rewrite the Use Cases in Section 2.3 to match the code logic:
   - UC: Hierarchical Knowledge Enrichment (Update with actual chunking and metadata logic found in the Python/C# code).
   - UC: Enriched RAG Chat (Update with the real multi-source retrieval and query expansion flow).
   - UC: Tenant-level Access Control (Update with the actual EF Core Global Query Filter and Qdrant collection isolation implementation).

3. REORDERING & SIMPLIFYING "BUSINESS DICTIONARY":
   - Move the "Business Dictionary & System Prompt Configuration" Use Case to the VERY END of Section 2.3.
   - Re-define it as "Internal Entity & Key-Value Mapping." 
   - Simplify its scope: It should focus on storing simple key-value pairs for organizational context (e.g., mapping titles like "Mr. A = General Director" or specific jargon to simple definitions).

### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Format: Keep the Markdown structure of the file.
- Accuracy: Use the real metadata keys (e.g., "hierarchy_level", "parent_id", etc.) discovered in the code.
- Tone: Academic, professional, and technical.
- Language: Vietnamese.
