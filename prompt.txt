Role: Senior .NET Fullstack DeveloperTask: Implement the "System Prompt" Management module in the WebApp project.1. General Requirements & StandardsPage Title: "Cấu hình prompt hệ thống".Route Path: /SystemPrompt.Primary Logic: Strictly adhere to the architectural patterns, AJAX workflows, and UX guardrails defined in the attached UIShareLogic.txt111111.Design Pattern: Use Partial Injection (Static Shell + Dynamic List Partial + Shared Modal for Forms). Service & Model SynchronizationAPI Inspection: Analyze the ChatService (Web API) for all System Prompt endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).Cloning: Clone all associated DTO and Request models from the ChatService API to the WebApp project that related to the endpoints of SystemPrompt(do not invent new structures).Backend: Create SystemPromptBusiness.cs and SystemPromptController.cs to handle data operations, supporting backend pagination and filtering.3. View & UI LogicShell (Index):Implement a search bar with a 500ms debounce3.Add a Status Dropdown for filtering: int IsActive (-1: Initialized/All, 0: Inactive, 1: Active). Include a "Create" button4.List Partial (_List): Render a table with the following columns5:STT: Calculated sequential index: $STT = (CurrentPage - 1) \times PageSize + CurrentRowIndex + 1$6.Name: Display the Name field.Content: Display the Content field.Status: Display the status using consistent Badge indicators (e.g., Active/Inactive)7.Pagination: Implement backend-driven pagination at the bottom of the list8.4. Scripts & Modal UXAJAX Loop: Implement the full communication cycle (Trigger → Request → Injection) in system-prompt.js9999.Shared Modal: Load Create/Edit forms into the #modal-content-container10.Scrollable Modal: Enforce max-height and overflow-y: auto for the modal content to ensure readability.Focus Delay: Apply a 100ms delay for auto-focusing the primary input field upon injection: setTimeout(() => input.focus(), 100);.5. Feedback & UX GuardrailsLoading State: Always display a visual spinner/overlay while a Partial View is being fetched11.Action Feedback: All POST/PUT/DELETE operations must process JSON responses and show Toastr notifications12.Destructive Actions: Use SweetAlert2 with an explicit confirmation dialog for the Delete action13.
