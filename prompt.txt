Act as a Senior .NET Developer.

**Context:**
We need to finalize the configuration for the **Storage Service** to run in the Production/Docker environment.
Currently, the S3/MinIO configuration is in `appsettings.Development.json` (pointing to `localhost`).

**Task:**
Create or Update the `Services/StorageService/appsettings.json` file (Production configuration).

**Requirements:**
1.  **Replicate Structure:** Copy the exact S3 configuration structure (Section keys) from `appsettings.Development.json`.
2.  **Adjust Values for Docker:**
    * **ServiceUrl:** Change from `http://localhost:9000` to `http://minio:9000` (Use the container name defined in docker-compose).
    * **ExternalUrl:** If there is a key for public access (used for browser redirects), keep it as `http://localhost:9000` or adapt as needed, but the internal communication URL must use the container name.
    * **Credentials:** You can set placeholders (e.g., "Set_By_Env_Var") or default values for `AccessKey` and `SecretKey`, as these should be overridden by Docker Environment variables for security.
3.  **Docker Compose Verification:**
    * Review the `storageservice` section in the root `docker-compose.yml`.
    * Ensure that we are injecting the specific values (AccessKey, SecretKey) using the double-underscore syntax (e.g., `StorageSettings__AccessKey`) so they override whatever is in the json file.

**Output:**
1.  Provide the full content for `Services/StorageService/appsettings.json`.
2.  Confirm the environment variable mapping in `docker-compose.yml`.
