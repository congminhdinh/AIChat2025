Role: Senior .NET Fullstack Developer Task: Update the Feedback Statistics Dashboard (Stat/Index.cshtml) for WebApp.

1. Initialization & Core Data Flow

Initial Load: On DOMContentLoaded, execute three parallel tasks:

Summary Stats: Call ChatBusiness.CountMessage() (ensure there is an endpoint like GET /chat/count) to display the Total Message Count.

Chart Data: Call an endpoint to get the total count of Likes (Ratings=1) and Dislikes (Ratings=2). Update the Pie Chart/Visuals with these numbers.

Feedback List: Call GET /chat/chat-feedback/ with default Ratings = 0 (Initial state) and PageIndex = 1.

2. List Rendering & Pagination (Follow UIShareLogic.txt)

Partial View Pattern: The feedback list must be rendered via a Partial View to support AJAX-based pagination without reloading the whole page.

Pagination Logic: Use event delegation on .page-link. When a page is clicked:

Trigger an AJAX call to the controller.

Update only the #feedback-table-container.

Ensure the scroll position is maintained or smoothly moved to the top of the table.

3. UI/UX & Layout Requirements

Dashboard Structure: 2-column grid. Left (300px): Statistics cards and Pie Chart. Right (Flexible): Feedback Table.

Scrolling & Responsiveness: * The main container must be scrollable (overflow-y: auto).

Avoid overflow: hidden that cuts off content.

Table Column Logic: * The Bot Response column must be the widest.

Use white-space: normal and word-wrap: break-word to ensure long AI responses wrap and fill the available space.

Do not truncate the Bot Response in this view; let it expand the row height naturally.

Filtering: Use the dropdown in the header (Thích, Không thích, Mặc định) to re-trigger the list fetch with the selected Ratings filter.

4. Technical Guardrails

Tenant Security: Ensure all requests pass the TenantId (handle this via the ICurrentUserProvider on the backend).

Naming Convention: All JSON interactions must use PascalCase to match the .NET Backend DTOs.

Visual Consistency: Use the color scheme from the previous designs (Primary Blue: #0d6efd, Success Green: #198754, Danger Red: #dc3545).

Loading States: Show a spinner within the table container during AJAX calls as per UIShareLogic.txt.
