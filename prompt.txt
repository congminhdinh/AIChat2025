Role: Expert .NET Fullstack Developer Task: Fix SignalR initialization error and update Bot message UI in Chat/Index.cshtml.

1. Fix Bug: ReferenceError: signalR is not defined

Issue: The chat.js script is executing before the SignalR library is fully loaded or recognized.

Requirement: In Index.cshtml, ensure the SignalR CDN script tag is placed correctly within the @section Scripts.

Action: Move the SignalR library reference to the top of the scripts section, ensuring it loads before chat.js. Check if the library is being blocked or if a local fallback is needed.

2. Update Bot Message UI (Interaction Icons)

Objective: Add a subtle action row (Like, Dislike, Comment) under every message generated by the Bot (left-aligned messages).

CSS Update: Add the following styles to the <style> block in Index.cshtml:

Create a .msg-footer container with display: flex and a small gap.

Define .action-btn styles: no border, transparent background, subtle grey color (#888), and a primary color hover effect.

HTML Template Update: * Locate the message rendering logic (likely a template string) within chat.js.

Append a .msg-footer div inside the .msg-bubble for Bot messages only.

Include three SVG icons (Like, Dislike, and Message/Comment) using a clean, modern set (e.g., Bootstrap Icons or Lucide/Feather style).

3. UI/UX Standards

Placement: The icons should appear small and non-intrusive, directly below the bot's text response.

Interactivity: Ensure the buttons have a clear hover state (cursor: pointer). No backend logic is required for these buttons yet; they should just be visual placeholders.

Consistency: Maintain the "Gemini-like" clean aesthetic already established in the view.
