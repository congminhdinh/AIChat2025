Please update only Section 4.2.2.3 (Biểu đồ Trình tự) in the provided file 4.2.2_Thiet_ke_lop.md. The rest of the document (class descriptions, attributes, and methods) must remain exactly the same.

Please redraw the two sequence diagrams using PlantUML syntax with the following specific logic and Vietnamese annotations:

1. Use Case 1: Data Isolation and Access Control (Cô lập dữ liệu và Kiểm soát truy cập)

Goal: Show how the system enforces multi-tenant isolation during a data request.

Participants: Client, ApiGateway, CurrentTenantProvider, TenantDbContext/Interceptor, SQL Server.

Key steps to illustrate:

Client sends a request with a JWT token.

ApiGateway/Middleware extracts the TenantId claim from the JWT.

CurrentTenantProvider stores and provides this TenantId.

TenantDbContext applies a Global Query Filter automatically using the TenantId.

SQL Server executes the query with the injected WHERE TenantId = ... clause.

Show the Interceptor logic: when saving data, it auto-injects the TenantId into the entity.

2. Use Case 2: Legal Q&A with Multi-source RAG (Hỏi đáp pháp luật với RAG đa nguồn)

Goal: Show the asynchronous flow of a RAG pipeline that retrieves data from both local company rules and global law.

Participants: User, ChatHub (.NET), RabbitMQ, ChatProcessor (Python), QdrantService, OllamaService.

Key steps to illustrate:

User sends a message via SignalR to ChatHub.

ChatHub publishes a UserPromptReceivedEvent to RabbitMQ.

ChatProcessor (Python) consumes the message and performs Query Expansion and Keyword Extraction.

Hybrid Search: ChatProcessor calls QdrantService to search in parallel: (i) Tenant's private data and (ii) Global Law (TenantId=1).

Apply RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) to merge results and Fallback logic.

OllamaService generates a response based on the structured context.

ChatProcessor sends the result back via RabbitMQ to ChatHub to broadcast to the User.

Requirements for the output:

Only provide the updated PlantUML code and the accompanying Vietnamese descriptive text for these 2 diagrams.

All annotations, labels, and titles inside the diagrams must be in Vietnamese.

Keep the technical terms like Tenant, Service, RAG, Hybrid Search, Middleware as per the project's terminology rules (SOP 2026).

Ensure the diagrams are detailed enough to reflect the class designs described in sections 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2.
