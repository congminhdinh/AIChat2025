Context: I have completed the chat.js logic which handles:

Fetching the conversation list via AJAX.

Fetching message history via AJAX.

Sending new messages and rendering the response.

Task: Now, please finalize the Views/Chat/Index.cshtml file. You need to apply the new "Gemini-style" HTML structure we discussed, but strictly prepared for dynamic data integration.

Requirements:

Clean Up:

Remove ALL static/dummy data. (Delete the hardcoded "Lorem ipsum" messages, delete the hardcoded <li> items in the sidebar).

The sidebar list and the chat content area should be empty on initial load (waiting for JS to populate them).

Add Identifiers (IDs):

Add id="conversation-list" to the sidebar <ul> so chat.js can append items there.

Add id="chat-content" to the main chat container so chat.js can append messages there.

Add id="msg-input" to the input field.

Add id="btn-send" to the send button.

Add id="btn-new-chat" to the "New Chat" button.

Script Reference:

Add the reference to the JavaScript file at the bottom of the view: <script src="~/Scripts/Chat/chat.js" asp-append-version="true"></script>

Preserve Styling:

Keep the internal <style> block (CSS) exactly as it was in the previous design (The Gemini-style layout). Do not strip the CSS.

Output: Please provide the full, clean code for Views/Chat/Index.cshtml.
